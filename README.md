# Qrcode
QR Code is a machine-readable matrix barcode that uniquely represents information. With the increase in optical capabilities of smartphones, the use of QR codes started increasing.

In this project, we will build a QR Code generator using Python Modules.

We will be using Tkinter and pyqrcode , png  modules in Python to build this project. We use the Tkinter module to build the GUI to take the following inputs:

text/URL to convert to QR Code
location to save the QR code with name
By using pyqrcode we decide size of the QR code.
Then we generate the QR code from the above inputs and save in the given location using the pyqrcode module.
After this, It show the pop up message to confirm the user that the image is saved.
